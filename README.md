# Week 5 Fantasy Writeup
#### By: Squid ðŸ¦‘

Hey guys it's your favorite brown-boy. Aka not Warren. Aka Sidd. Aka Squid. Aka The Person WHO FINALLY BEAT DAME.
Jk I'm not actually that proud of that (*hides recently printed golden plaque which has October 8th engraved in it*). Lets trash talk Dame a little later, shall we?

I've been doing AWS all day and figured I needed a break, so how else to spend your free time than doing a very in-depth fantasy write-up? eh? no? okay. Well I'm still gonna do one.

Disclaimer: there will be a lot of typos. This is gonna be too long for me to re-read. Ian I expect a fully curated list of all my typos and you fixing them. Thanks.

For my writeup, I wanted to talk about where we all stand as a league. I still have Fantasy Pros and thought I'd utilize some of its advanced stats. 5 Weeks into the season we have a good idea of pretty much how all the teams in the league look. I wanted to do an analysis on EACH team and essentially break down their hopes as the season progresses. With that, let's start.

----------------
(all stats from Fantasy Pros)

## Pre-Season Power Rankings

And lets take a look at the current projections. Shows how quickly things change. 1 or 2 good pickups and your whole season can change.

## Power Rankings through Week 5 and Beyond

## Justin's team Outlook
Justin was the 6th ranked team post draft. Justin had the 3rd best receivers with Michael Thomas and De'Andre Hopkins. Justin went with a high end receiver heavy strat (not to the caliber of Anthony but still...) and that realistically should've paid off in a 0.5 PPR league. 

### Analysis
Unfortunately the 2 stud receiver strat  didn't pay off, and through 5 weeks, according to the power rankings, strength of schedule, and a myriad of other stats, Justin is last in the league in Points For and 3rd highest in PA. Bad scheduling and an underperforming team doesn't sit well in fantasy, Justin needs to start trending up, and hopefully quick before the season ends.

### Moves Made
Justin pulled the trigger on Hopkins, on a depth achieving trade netting TY Hilton and Tevin Coleman. It took his 2nd best receiver(at the time, Hopkins looks better now) to get the deal done. Hilton is hobbled right now (surprise surprise, Reece trades player who gets injured shortly after) but with Luck at QB, has been having a pretty good season averaging 13pts a game. Coleman is a good flex player who had a lot of stand alone value with Freeman being out. Given Freeman's injury history, he's a great handcuff, who is able to be flex'ed. A couple other players like this are Royce Freeman, and Austin Ekeler. Justin should turn it around with the Patriots looking back to their normal self, and Michael Thomas should continue playing well, and hopefully LeSean McCoy figuring out how to run again. Maybe a couple of snow games ought to do it. But if Justin doesn't get a win next week, we might see a Michael Thomas trade coming soon.

----------------

## Thomas's team Outlook
Oh how the mighty fall. Turns out having Gurley and Gordon on your roster is a pretty good strat.
Unfortunately Thomas didn't bid his boys up in the draft and waited until Devonta Freeman as his first pick. Freeman has 11 pts in fantasy this year. Due to an injury, we haven't seen enough from Freeman and thus the success of Thomas's team.

### Analysis
Thomas has a projected record of 5-8, although I do think he'll do better, considering he was missing his best RB until now. Freeman needs to stay healthy, and with Coleman right behind him, even a minor injury nets Coleman a higher target share. Freeman is the better back, let's not kid ourselves, but much like Thomas, Atlanta is 1-4, and in must-win mode, you know they're going to start the healthier player. 

Thomas does have the "Ferrari" as Joe Buck constantly reminds us every time the  Vikings play, in Stefon Diggs. Diggs is a "reception-whore" as I like to call it, and when Cousins gets tunnel vision and just passes to one player (be Diggs or Thielen), he's extremely dangerous. Diggs and Hill are very explosive, although Tyreek has had some tough matchups recently, with Sherman, Harris and Ramsey covering him the last 3 weeks. But believe me, I'm a huge Tyreek Hill fan, and looking at Hills schedule, and the fact that Kenyan Drake has been having FRANK GORE take his carries, I think Thomas is gonna string together a couple of wins and in my mind will be in playoff contention in the near future. Drake is going to be much better, I believe as the season progresses who is Thomas's X-Factor.

### Moves Made
Thomas traded me Woods for Lynch. The original deal was supposed to be Ekeler, but I saw Melvin go down a couple times early in the year, and really wanted to keep Ekeler. I counter-ed with Lynch, who is the better RB of the 2. Thomas didn't have room for Woods early on in the season, and considering how depleted I was at reciever, anything over waiver-quality was a win in my books. But holy-hell Robert Woods has been playing like a WR1 this year, and the stats prove it. In a 12 man league heâ€™s got a PRK of 12. Lynch has also been playing well, but the Raiders idiotic play-calling led to this Marshawn Lynch quote, when they decided to throw an interception on a 1st and goal on the 1.

> "I done seen it happen to me on the game's biggest stage. Now it's happened to me in regular-season game. It's all right though" 
> -Marshawn Lynch after loss to Chargers.

Narrator: "It definetly wasn't alright."

Lynch will get the ball more now as knee-jerk reaction to make things better, and that'll help Thomas for-sure.

----------------

## Damians's team Outlook
OH BOY I GET TO ROAST DAMIAN. HELL FUCKING YEA. Damian has tormented me for the last year and any sort of fantasy sports I've played against him in. He's made my life absolutely miserable, let me tell you, there is no worse, AND I REPEAT, THERE IS NO WORSE FEELING THAN LOSING TO DAME. And you know what's worse than losing to him, having him offer his SHITTY trades after. GOSH DAME, GOSH. He beat me twice last year including once in the playoffs, which had me hunting for the national suicide hotline number... He was undefeated against me as Reece's co-owner in Fantasy B-Ball, A TEAM I BUILT. Damian has had his way with me... Until now. Finally. I feel so free.


![Freedom](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKKDNOHo6LoNqgw/giphy.gif)



All jokes aside, and in all honesty it speaks to Dame's sports knowledge. Smart guy, and good guy as well, he's one of the most educated sports heads i've met. Having said that, this year has been rough fantasy wise for Damian. He's got the highest PA in the league. He put up 124 points this week, and still lost. Damian had a very good draft strategy. Draft the Elite RBs. In retrospect 136$ on 2 stud ppr monsters, ought to win you the league. But Dame forgot one thing, and the most important mantra in fantasy that I just made up.
> "Draft good, healthy players, on good teams"
> -Siddharth Sharma the sacred all-knowing one.

Arizona is not a good team Dame.

### Analysis
No but really, I'm shocked that Johnson has been this under-used. Mike Mccoy is the Kevin Sumlin of Running backs coaching. Just like Sumlin has the IQ of a 4 year old when instructing his QB, Mike Mccoy does the same for his RB's. David Johnson has 15 Receptions in 5 games. FIF-TEEN. 3 PER GAME. T-H-R-E-E. Fucking Adam Thielen had 14 in one game. But compare him to any other elite RBs such as Gordon, Gurley, Kamara, Elliott, and McCaffery, you'll see very clearly where the problem is. Based of his draft value, he has not produced. Mccoy has gone full retard mode in David Johnson's usage, and frankly I'm not sure if he still realizes it. If the Niners didn't have a CJ Beathard fumble, DJ wouldn't have had an easy 2 yard TD. If DJ comes back to form, averaging 5-7 receptions a game, and re-establishes himself as an integral part of the offense, Dame is gonna be a top 5 team, but if he doesn't...oh boy.. Dame's in trouble. I think he will though, someone has to be watching some film in Arizona and saying, "Jeez Mike, why aren't we doing what got us to the NFC Championship game 3 years ago."

### Moves Made
Dame traded Wentz for Freeman which gave him more RB depth. Dames reciever have been playing very well, and speaking to Dame's knowledge, the acquisition of Tyler Boyd, essentially a WR 2 on waiver, has given him some hope. Tate had an off week this week (thanks Kenny), but I see Dame turning it around. He has a projected record of 5-8. I think he'll be some where around there, but if his team plays to his potential, Dame will make the playoffs.

----------------

## Anthony's team Outlook
We all laughed at Anthony when he drafted Odell, Julio, and AB as his first 3 picks, and then minimal picks there-after. We chuckled when he went 0-3. And going into last week a matchup against the highest scoring offense in our league with Jaiden, we thought Anthony was doomed. Boy were we wrong. Anthony put up 159.7 PTS. EVERY BODY WENT OFF. Im too lazy to check but I'm pretty sure thats the largest margin of defeat this year.

### Analysis
Anthony has elite WR's, let's settle that. He also has James White who should be designated as a fucking WR because he had 0 RUSHING YARDS this week. He stands next to Brady and is thus considered a RB. Brady has so many check downs to White, he's made him a top 10 fantasy PPR Rb. Absolutely fitting that of all the teams, James White is on Anthonys WR Emporium. What kind of elite rb has 0 rushing yards smh. Anthony listen to me, START. JAMES. WHITE. 
### Moves Made
Anthony has had quite a bit of moves. Trading Odell for AJ Green and Morris. AJ has been amazing this year as well. Spending literally almost all of his FAAB money on Lindsay and Alex Smith. Lindsay is a RB 2 this year. He's played very well and Anthony looks decent at RB. His receivers will give him a chance every week. Anthony is literally boom or bust, because there is absolutely no knowing how his team will perform week to week. He's projected to finish 6-7 but if his players keep popping off, and maybe if Ridley saves some TD's for Julio, Anthony could very well make the playoffs. He currently has a 30% chance.


----------------
## Oron's team Outlook
I have no negative things to say about Oron. He's a homie, he's nice, he hates Warren, what more can you ask for. Fantasy-wise he's 1 game under .500 after his loss to Ian, but this back and forth affair, should still get him into the playoffs. Oron has pretty good depth at every position.

### Analysis
Oron has a very well rounded team. Elliott, Hyde, Marvin and Keenan Allen along with Wentz at QB. Oron will make the playoffs in my mind, but his team has been fairly predictable so far. Playing to their projected rankings, not too far high or too low. Elliott has some good games coming up, Carlos Hyde looks like an RB1 and Carson Wentz is almost back to full health. Oron did a good job drafting being a first year, and putting together a very well balanced team (*cough*  Anthony).

### Moves Made
Oron traded Royce for Wentz, giving him a starting caliber QB. Great move. His weakest potential spot has been fixed via trade early in the season. Maybe we see Devante Parker play a game and he can be worth his high draft pick. Oron will always be a challenge to beat. If your team has a great game you can beat Oron, but if any player performs under projection, Oron will beat you. As of now Oron looks to have an even 50% shot at making the playoffs.

----------------
## Jaiden's team Outlook
Jaiden's stacked. Fournette (broken hammy boi). Yeldon. Kamara. Davante Adams. A fantasy functional Sammy Watkins (thanks Mahomes), who hasn't existed since his rookie year. And Isaiah Fucking Crowell. Jaiden in my mind is potentially a playoff lock. His team died last week, but no one was beating Anthony last week. Aside from that hiccup he's pretty much tied for the top PF. Fournette is out, but Jaiden does have Yeldon though so he hasn't faced any repercussions.

### Analysis
Jaiden's going to make noise come January. Kamara's numbers should settle down considering that Ingram is back, but he's no doubt a top 5 Rb still. Kamara has been amazing this year, so far without Ingram. Although I do have doubts on how he plays with Ingram, but we'll see how that plays out. His usage rate is insane, dare I say ... unsaistanable?? Fournette hasn't been healthy yet at all so we haven't seen much from him, but Yeldon has more than made up for his loss. Davante Adams is a fringe WR1. Aaron Rodgers loves him, and anyone who Rodgers loves, you roster in fantasy. Even if their name is Equanimeous St. Brown or Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Who tf came up with those names lol.

### Moves Made
I think Jaiden has the fleecing of the year potentially. TJ Yeldon for Jamison Crowder who is happily sitting on the waiver wire right now. Im not sure why Ian did this trade, Yeldon has value with Fournette in, and given his injury history I would have 100% held onto him. Jaiden makes up for Fournette, and that trade may have saved his year, as his 2nd pick in the draft could've been a dud. Fournette should be back at some point tho, not like it matters for Jaiden. Jaiden is projected 7-6 with a ceiling of a 10-3 season. I think he gets to the ceiling. Big questions for Jaiden are how is Kamara going to perform. Kamara has been keeping Jaiden more than afloat, but again, Ingram is back, and Ingram is good, and Ingram, most importantly has fresh legs.


----------------
## Mike's team Outlook
Oh man, 1 year ago Mike had bum boy Isaiah Crowell as his starting RB. He was sitting 0-5. He was regretting every decision he made in the draft. Last year ended, and Mike has rebounded. Mike is 4-1 and is almost a playoff lock, barring any health set backs of his players.

### Analysis
Joe Mixon has played well, injured for a bit but should be fine soon, Sony Michel has found a home thanks to Burkhead going down, and I think he's here to stay, even if Burkhead does come back. Cooper Kupp and Juju are absolutely blooming. Both 2nd year WR's are playing out of their mind right now. Kupp had a concussion, but he should be back next week and Juju has been dancing in the end zone all year. He has Amari Cooper, who I'm not sure why he's starting. Amari is the only ? mark on his team, and if he gets looks, he plays well. Derek Carr has tunnel vision (the bad kind unlike Kirk Cousins) and he absolutely refuses to throw it down the field to Cooper. God forbid a ball does come to Cooper, there is a very good chance he's gonna drop it. Stay away from Cooper, start your other Bama Boi, Ridley.
### Moves Made
Mike let go of Brieda and Cole for Calvin Ridley and Juju and I think it was a pretty big win for Mike. Juju and Ridleys numbers aren't sustainable at all but they're still the number 2 receivers respecitvely. Juju is a little bit more sustainable than Ridley, however. Given Atlanta does have a drunk mind at the helm of their play-calling, Ridley's skill should still outclass his idiotic OC's play calls.

Mike is projected to go 7-6 and Fantasy pros really likes him giving an upper prediction of 11-2 with an 80% chance to make the playoffs. Wow, great bounce back from Mike this year.

----------------
## Reece's team Outlook
Reece oh Reece. Reece has a 6th sense of trading away players right before they get injured. Guess what, he traded away Jay Ajayi, who was his first RB drafted, and Ajayi has just torn his ACL. I don't know what kind of voodoo shit Reece does, but goddamn, If Reece offers you a trade don't do it, he's from the future I'm absolutely convinced.

### Analysis
Reece has Ingram back, and he's gonna slot in at his RB1. AP, Derrick Henry, and RB 1 BUCK ALLEN are his RB's. He has a bunch of decent RB's and Ingram. At WR Odell was a pretty good deal for Reece. He also has De Andre fucking Hopkins. And man is Hopkins going off. If Reece makes noise in January, Watson has to stay healthy (yay), but man oh man is Hopkins playing well. Reece did have Adam Thielen and T.Y. Hilton, but Odell is due for more touches. If he doesn't get them hell just go do another interview on ESPN. 

Now this is probably a hot take, but I'm gonna give it any way. Mark Ingram. This man is being severely undervalued. People forget how well he did last year and is now an after thought. At the time Im writing this Ingram hasn't been played yet, but Im gonna put money on the fact that he'll outscore Kamara (need this to happen to get W in other league, so let me believe). Ingram was the goal line back last year. Kamara is the pass catching back. Im not saying Kamara isn't going to outscore Ingram rest of the season, but its fair to expect a 60-40 or maybe even a 55-45% target share favoring Kamara. Reece has a steal here and he should ride him to the end, true to his value (*cough Enunwa*).

[video](https://streamable.com/s/wdgcs/evyskn)

Edit: Bam, on point. Go Ingram (have him in another league, and he just won me the game.) Damn Jaiden, imagine drafting Ingrams's handcuff as your first pick. Jokes. Should be fun to see how it all works out.


### Moves Made
Reece traded for OBJ giving up Thielen and Ajayi, as well as Hopkins for Hilton and Freeman. This dude makes magical trades, He ended up with 2 WR1's out of trades. Thielen and Hilton are good, don't get me wrong, but Reece has definetly upgraded. Reece is a trade maestro, and if trends continue like they did last year. Reece will be playing games when they matter in January. Albeit with a completely different team than he drafted.

Reece is projected to go 7-6 with an upper record of 9-4. I see Reece with 8 wins, and 4 losses. He should've lost to me but he drugged me and made me start Watson. Funny how this continues to happen.

----------------
## Chris's team Outlook
The newcomer this year, yet not new to football at all. We all know Chris as the biggest Johnny Manziel fan known to date. Chris is also a Rams fan, which frankly I still don't understand considering he's from Florida. But okay...His fantasy team though... to be honest this is the one team I'm not sure how to fully assess. Chris could very well win the league, or he could dud out. This week wasn't good for him, granted that Evans and essentially Cooks were on Bye weeks.

### Analysis
Chris took Dalvin Cook and Kareem Hunt as his RB's and those looked like solid picks at the time. Hunt has been playing very well, even in that pass heavy KC offense. Cook though, after having a great couple of games early last year, he also has joined Leonard Fournette on the broke hammy bois crew, and not getting as many starts as he should. Chris does have Matt Breida, who I like but Brieda is also made out of glass. If healthy, Chris can win the league, as he is stacked at WR and RB. If health is not on his side, Chris could miss out on the playoffs.

### Moves Made
Chris traded Ridley and Juju for Brieda and Cole. I think Mike came out on the better end of this trade as Juju has been absolutely balling out. Still Cole has a lot of potential and could pop for 15+ any week given Blake Bortles can throw a spiral (and/or) not off his linemen's head..

Doink...
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/g6i4j/pngdav" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

Fantasy Pros has Chris Finishing 7-6 as projected and 8-5 as upper limit. I agree, but I still do think we'll see Chris in the playoffs. His team could go off like they did last week vs me putting up 146 points.

----------------
## Ian's team Outlook
Ian's got a solid team with a top 10 player at each major position. His debth RB situation may be of concern after hearing the news on Jay Ajayi. Still he has Thielen who has had an amazing year. Ian remains competitive and is in the upper echelon of points for every week. Assessing that RB situation must happen for Ian, if he plans to win it all.
### Analysis
Saquon Barkley.
[Saquon](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WebbedLongAnemone-size_restricted.gif)

He is sooo good. Barkley has given Ian a very sturdy RB to build around, which you absolutely must have if you want to win a fantasy Championship. Barkley continues to be almost a 20 ppg player. If Ian can get a little more depth, I think he could easily take it all. Im looking at Aaron Jones or Kerryon to breakout, if Ian has a shot to win it. If they do, Ians depth puts him above a lot of the other teams.

### Moves Made
Odell for AJ Green and Morris
Ajayi and Thielen for Odell

Ian is projected to finish 7-6 with an upper record limit of 9-4. He should make the playoffs with ease, assuming his team stays healthy, which it hasn't really done this year. Saquon was banged up at the end of the game last week too so its going to be something to watch. Let's see what depth RB's Ian pulls out next week.


## James's team Outlook
James Land aka Mr.Commish, also the guy who put 81$ for a guy who has yet to play a snap.
"But Sidd...I got James Conner..."...shut nerd. Sorry had to get you back for that one.

### Analysis
I'll be honest, I looked at James's team right after the draft, and I did not think he would have a good season...like at all. I didn't like what I saw at all. James thankfully picked up James Conner, and that gave his Le'Veon pick a lot of security.

Conner is no Bell, let's get that straight, but when fed the ball he has shown to produce, putting up 2 30+ point games this year, tied with Kamara and Gurley as the only other RB's to do that this fall. That's some elite company. The time is running out on Conner, but James doesn't have anything to worry about considering he has Bell. 

Now let's say Bell gets traded. Now we're essentially cloning talent. Conner replaces Bell and James gets Le'Veon's numbers still. That's the absolute best case for James, and considering Ajayi just went out, I don't think James would be too mad if Bell went to the Eagles. Even if he is a Cowboys fan.

### Moves Made
James has had no need to make any trades. His team is rounded out well, but after starting 3-0, he has struggled a bit last 2 weeks, albeit due to bad matchups. Brees is playing out of his mind and Landry is getting his targets. Kelce is being Kelce, and hot take #2 here, I believe he's the best Tight end in the NFL. Much like Ian, James is well rounded at each position. Regardless of how the Bell situations works out, James will get better once Bell is back. To what degree depends on what the Steelers decide to do. If Bell is traded James is the instant favorite to win the league.

Fantasy pros has James finishing between 7-6 and 8-5. I can see him going around there as well.

## Sidd's team Outlook
Wow, I finally get to do my writeup? Let's be honest last year was pretty much luck for me. Somehow I finished 10-3 last year, but I was never truly happy with my roster. I lacked big name talent and if it wasn't for a massive fleecing of Warren in a trade that ended me up with Mark Ingram and Zeke for AJ Green and Orleans Darkwa (lol).

You need big name talent to win, I think I did that this year.

### Analysis
A lot of people tell me, I just copied Thomas from last year, and to an extend I did. Gurley should've been obvious. Im surprised more people didn't bid me up for him. Gordon though, I was high on Gordon (L -oh -L) for so long. Melvin Gordon has increased in efficiency every year he played ever since college. His numbers keep getting better. The previous year is always Gordon's floor. Melvin was my X-Factor and I think he'll do very well. Ekeler is a great handcuff. Funchess is a good projection receiver. Maybe Antonio Droppaway and Mike Williams can appear in my roster at some point as well. Overall I'm very satasfied with my roster and don't feel like I need to make any moves and panic trade anyone yet.


### Moves Made
I traded for Woods, thank you Thomas, you addressed my biggest weakness and gave me a WR1. Hopefully Woods can continue this production. Mahomes has been excellent for me, and if I made the right starts I could've been 5-0. A lot of people doubt my WR Depth, but my other Gordon will finally get a start this week. Yup Josh Gordon will be in my fantasy lineup.

I'm not gonna toot my horn but I feel like I have a good shot to win the league barring injuries, and barring my retardation when starting players. I'm riding that Mahomes wave to the end.

Fantasy Pros has me ranked as the Top seed with a 7-6 floor and a whopping 11-2 Ceiling. I don't think i'll make that, but If Gordon, Gurley, Gordon, Mahomes/Watson and Woods keep producing, who the hell knows.


Wow this writeup is long as fuck. Holy shit. Let's do the rest of the superlatives, that James usually does.


## Top Team: 

Jaiden put up 133 making him the top team. Followed by Anthony at 128 and me at 124. Jaiden continues his dominance.

## Highest Scoring Loser: 

I'm sorry Dame, but I beat you. Long overdue. But Finally. Demons have been Exorcised.
Dame would have beaten 8/11 teams this week. Anyone but me Jaiden and Anthony. Sowwie Dame. :(

## Lowest Scoring Winner: 

Reece is the lowest scoring Winner, but he also won by 40 points. Good week for Reece.

## Top Player: 

James Conner, again James continues to horde all the awards. Rigged league smh.

## Worst Start: 

Guess who won this award. Just guess. Fucking James. Best and Worst start on the same team lol. Broncos D with -2 points.

## Worst Bench: 

Weird week, all the winners had the best benches. Dame had the Worst loser bench of 32.3. Starting Tyler Lockett over Agholor wins Dame the game just barely this week. Thank god he didn't start him.

## Bottom of the Barrel:

I'm sorry Justin, you started the wrong QB, again. No combination of players gets you a win against Anthony this week. Justin should(and needs to) turn it around next week.


## Weekly Challenge: IDK YET DAME SEND IT BRO.

Alright guys thanks for reading this wall of text. Sorry If I said mean things about your team. Sorry about the grammar fuck ups. And sorry Im gonna beat you all this year in the championship.
Gnite.
